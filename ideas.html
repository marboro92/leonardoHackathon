            <p>Using <a href="https://developers.google.com/vision/face-detection-concepts">Google Vision's face detection</a>, which returns the bounding rectangles for faces, the gallery below (example from a Vizlly website) could be automatically cropped to avoid clipping away people's heads.</p>

            <h2>YouTube Video Integration</h2>
            <p>Social media rules us all, most major hotels have already created a presence with tons of social media networks. One of them being <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/">Youtube</a>. Hotels like  Best Western try to keep their Youtube videos fresh and inviting. Let's allow our Vizlly users use Youtube urls to create video content items. This could allow for future features ie: User logs in with their youtube account and we can display a list of videos that would like to add as content.

            <p>Integrate with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> API's to show the hotel's most recent social media updates directly on their vizlly website. This would help Vizlly users easily produce dynamic content on their website from what they already post on social media.

                <li>/leobot find "$pid_name" : Return a list of possible properties matches the $pid_name</li>
                <li>/leobot cdmstree $pid : Show all the cdms_tree nodes the pid belongs to</li>

            <h2>Vizlly User Activity</h2>
            <p>Currently, Customer Success Coaches receive close to no data on Vizlly usage after implementation, other then what they hear on their phone calls. Imagine how improved the customer experience would be if Coaches could see how their customers interact with Vizlly in realtime, allowing us to react quickly and be proactive as time goes on. And maybe, just maybe, we can chip away at that Churn percentage.
We would do this by facilitating more data communication between Vizlly and <a href="https://www.marketo.com/">Marketo</a>, then in turn through <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_quickstart_intro.htm">Salesforce</a>.

            <h2>Website Asset Scrape</h2>
            <p>New customers to Vizlly could simply enter in their existing website and we'd scrape/extract the visual content and the copy to create their new website in Vizlly. This would give customers a place to start as it can often feel overwhelming to start with nothing.  From there the customer could add additional pages, tweaks ect.  We could start on a smaller scale by simply extracting the visuals.

            <h2>Content Scores for Vizlly and/or VScape</h2>
            <p>Develop a Leonardo content score and assign it to properties.  This could be applied and exposed in both Vizlly and VScape to help the user determine if they have loaded the right content and organized it properly.  This could include factors like the total number of assets loaded, the quality of the assets loaded, the type of assets loaded, assets per category, asset associations, etc.

            <h2>Obtain Property Info With Search Results from Google and Bing</h2>
            <p>The accuracy of our property data is key to our enterprise business for both our Chain and Channel customers.  Over time our data can grow stale and our data accuracy is diminished.  We are almost 100% reliant on the data we are sent by customers to maintain our data.  When customers stop sending us data, or do not send updates for extended periods our data loses its accuracy.  This project would capture search results from Google and Bing to provide additional sources of information to be used in determining the accuracy of our data - leading to the identification of closed, rebranded and duplicate properties.
